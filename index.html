          <blockquote class="indented-blockquote">
            I transitioned into software after taking a data analytics course using R in University. I spent some time self-studying Python and CS concepts, then sought additional training and enrolled in Ada Developers, a coding school for women and gender-expansive adults. This intensive experience allowed me to refine my programming abilities, broaden my technical knowledge, and adopt industry best practices in software engineering.<br><br>

            I enjoy creating apps that are inline with my hobbies, I love to read manga and webtoon and decided to create a mobile
            app that would translate the text in boxes in realtime as it can be challenging to get English translations. I look forward to 
            connecting with you and discussing how I can help bring your vision to life.

            <!-- I interned at Anaconda, Inc., the leading data science platform. Working alongside exceptional engineers, I made contributitions to our Payments team and learned the best practices of Software Engineering. This experience refined my problem-solving abilities and strengthened my collaboration skills within a team environment.
  
            If you are looking for a dedicated and driven software engineer to contribute to your organization's mission, I would love to connect and discuss how I can help bring your vision to life.  -->

              <ul class="experience">
              Worked on the Platform Payment Service team where I completed frontend and backend tickets, including syncing subscriptions and refactoring legacy code, bug fixes, and assisting in the development of the new Payments Service.
              Led agile scrum meetings and conducted code reviews. I also played a significant role in creating UI elements, such as the payments system portal entry and upgrade button.
