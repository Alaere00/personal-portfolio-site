# Personal Portfolio Site

## Introduction

It is common for developers to create a website to show off their web-dev skills and document their work and interests. These sites often feature things like:

- A professional introduction of themselves, careers, and interests
- A portfolio of projects that they've created and/or collaborated on
- A blog to share their experiences, thoughts, and/or subject matter expertise
- Other materials to share any non-coding interests and hobbies
- A site designed to express themselves

We will use HTML & CSS to create a static site whose content is our personal portfolio. Our personal portfolio site should contain information about ourselves and the coding work we've done.
